# Pinder

## Our Vision

* Each user is presented with picture of pet first
* User has choice to click 'Walkies' to agree to liking the pet, 'Down Boy' to reject
* If a match is made for both, user then gets shown picture of owner
* User then gets option to accept or reject
* If rejected process ends there (back to the beginning), if accepted user can start a conversation

## Site Rules

* Bio for both User and pet
* Picture for pet on their own
* Second picture of owner (can be with pet)
